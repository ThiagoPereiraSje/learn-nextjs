/* getStaticPaths fallback: false 
  1 - The paths returned from getStaticPaths will be rendered to HTML at build 
    time by getStaticProps.
  2 - If fallback is set to false, then any paths not returned by 
    getStaticProps will result in a 404 page.
  
  When to use ?
    The false value is most suitable if you have an application with a small number of paths to prerender.
    When new pages are not added often. Ex.: Blog.
*/

/* getStaticPaths fallback: true
  1 - The paths returned from getStaticPaths will be rendered to HTML at build 
    time by getStaticProps.
  2 - The paths that have not been generated at build time will not result in a 404 page. Instead,
    NextJS will serve a "fallback" version of the page on the first request to such a path.
  3 - In the background, NextJS will statically generate the requested path HTML and JSON. This
    includes running getStaticProps.
  4 - When that's done, the browser receives the JSON for the generated path.This will be used to
    automatically render the page with the required props. From the user's perspective, the page will
    be swapped from the fallback page to the full page.
  5 - At the same time, NextJS keeps track of the new list of pre-rendered pages. Subsequent requests
    to the same path will serve the generated page, just like other pages pre-rendered at build time.

  When to use ?
    The true value is most suitable if your app has a very large number of static pages that depend on data.
    
    A large e-commerce site.
    
    You want  all the product pages to be pre-rendered bu if you have a few thousand products, builds can take
    a really long time.
    
    You may statically generate a small subset of products that are popular and use fallback: true for the rest.
    
    When someone requests a page that's not generated yet, the user will see the page with a loading indicator.
    
    Shorty after, getStaticProps finishes and the page will be rendered with the requested data. From the onwards,
    everyone who requests the same page will get the statically pre-rendered page.
    
    This ensures that users always have a fast experience while preserving fast builds and the benefits of 
    Static Generation.

/* getStaticPaths fallback: 'blocking'
  1 - The paths returned from getStaticPaths will be rendered to HTML at build 
    time by getStaticProps.
  2 - The paths that have not been generated at build time will not result in a 404 page. Instead, on
    the first request, NextJS will render the page on the server and return the generated HTML.
  3 - When that's is done, the browser receives the HTML for generated path. From the user's perspective,
    it will transition from "the browser is requesting the page" to "the full page is loaded". There is
    no flash of loading/fallback state.
  4 - At the same time, NextJS keeps track of the new list of pre-rendered pages. Subsequent requests to the
    same path will serve the generated page, just like other pages pre-rendered at build time.

  When to use ?
    On a UX level, sometimes, people prefer the page to be loaded without a loading indicator if the wait time
    is a few milli seconds. This helps avoid the layout shift.

    Some crawlers did not support JavaScript. The loading page would be rendered and then the full page would
    be loaded which was causing a problem.

    The support team recommends fallback: true, and causing any problem use fallback: 'blocking'.
